/**
 * The {@code KeystrokeTextField} allows you to be notified about each keystroke
 * in the text field component.
 * This can for example be used to do a incremental filetring of a server
 * database and then display the matching records as you type.
 *
 * Please use the following component with care, it creates a request for every
 * keystroke per default. You can configure a keystrokeDelay which synchronizes
 * only after the specified delay. So someone who is typing rapidly doesn't
 * create lots of requests, instead the synchronization is triggered only when
 * the user stops typing for the specified amount of time (=keystrokeDelay).
