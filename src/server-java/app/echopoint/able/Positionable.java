/**
 * A <code>Positionable</code> is one that can be postioned anywhere on the
 * screen, regardless of the flow layout of other components.
 * <p>
 * By default the it acts like a normal component, and will be rendered with the
 * flow of its parent and siblings. The component has its Positioning property
 * set to POSITIONING_FLOW.
 * <p>
 * <h3>POSITIONING</h3>
 * 
 * However if the Positioning property is POSITIONING_ABSOLUTE or
 * POSITIONING_RELATIVE then the component will break out of the normal flow
 * layout and position themselves directly on the screen.
 * <p>
 * If the Positioning is POSITIONING_RELATIVE, then the component is positioned
 * at an at a point on the screen relative to its first positioned parent
 * component. If it has no parents that are positioned, then it will be
 * positioned relative to the origins of the client window.
 * <p>
 * If the Positioning is POSITIONING_ABSOLUTE, then the component is positioned
 * at an absolute point outside the normal flow of layout. The left, top, right
 * and bottom properties can be used to position the component.
 * <p>
 * If the Positioning is POSITIONING_FIXED, then the component is positioned at
 * an absolute point from the origin of the client window. The left, top, right
 * and bottom properties can be used to position the component.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Left, Top, Right, Bottom</h3>
 * Typically you would set the Left and Top properties in order to get a
 * Positionable to a specified location. However you can also use the Right and
 * Bottom properties.
 * <p>
 * For example you could position a component to 100 pixels in from the bottom
 * and 10 pixels if from the right by only settting the bottom and right
 * properties to 100 and 10 respectively. The width of the component will be
 * determined by the content.
 * <p>
 * A convenience method called <i>clearPositioning() </i> is provided to clear
 * all positioning and have the component acts like a normal flow component.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Z-INDEX</h3>
 * 
 * A <code>Positionable</code> also supports a z-idex, which controls how it
 * is layered over other components, especially other <code>Positionable</code>
 * 's.
 * <p>
 * If no zIndex is to apply then the Integer.MIN_VALUE can be used in which case
 * no zIndex will be set.
