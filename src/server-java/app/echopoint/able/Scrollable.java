 * A <code>Scrollable</code> is a component that can have a a fixed width 
 * and/or height, and can present scrollbars when the content of 
 * the component is too large to fit inside.
 * <p>
 * <h3>SCROLLBARS</h3>
 *
 * Since a <code>Scrollable</code> can be made a fixed size, by setting 
 * its width and/or height properties, it has support for
 * a scroll bar policy which controls how scroll bars are used if the content 
 * of the component will not fit into the fixed size.
 * <p>
 * If the scroll bar policy is NEVER, then no scroll bars will be shown 
 * and the content inside the component will be clipped to the bounding rectangle.
 * <p>
 * If the scroll bar policy is ALWAYS, then scroll bars will always be 
 * shown, regardless of whether the content is too big for the bounding rectangle, 
 * which allows the user to view all the content.
 * <p>
 * If the scroll bar policy is AUTO, then scroll bars will be 
 * shown when appropriate, ie when the content is too big for the bounding 
 * rectangle.
