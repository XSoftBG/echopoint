<h2>Contribute to EchoPoint</h2>

<p>We welcome contributions to the development of EchoPoint through either
of the following means:

<div id='wrapper' style='float: left; width: 100%;'>

<div id='actions' style='float: left; width: 75%;'>
<ul>
  <li>Contribute to the development and porting of components.  There are
  a lot of components that need to be ported over, as well as potentially
  new components that reflect the state of the art in AJAX toolkits.  The
  more people we get who are interested in creating custom components, the
  better EchoPoint will become.</li>
  <li>Donate to the project.  Donations help us allocate more time and
  resources to the development work.  Please use the paypal button to
  make a donation to the project.  You can use the message field to request
  the area or component for which you would like your donation to apply.
  You will be listed as a project sponsor in the <b>Sponsors</b> section.

<h2>EchoPoint Component Library</h2>

<p>EchoPoint component library for
<a href='http://echo.nextapp.com/site/echo3'>NextApp Echo3</a> web
application framework.  This project is a re-implementation of the
<a href='http://docs.rakeshv.org/java/echopointng/'>EchoPointNG</a> library
created by Brad Baker for
<a href='http://echo.nextapp.com/site/echo2'>NextApp Echo2</a> web
application framework.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href='https://echopoint.dev.java.net/files/documents/9134/103119/ComponentList.xls'>Component List</a>
  shows the list of components that will be re-implemented in EchoPoint.</li>
  <li>Interested developers read the
  <a href='https://echopoint.dev.java.net/files/documents/9134/103120/DeveloperGuide.pdf'>Developer Guide</a>
  for notes on getting involved with the re-implementation work.</li>

  the test application for the client-side framework.  This will be updated
  periodically as the test application is enhanced with tests for new
  components added to the library.  You may also download the client and
  server test applications that are available under

<h3>History</h3>

<p><a href='http://echopoint.sourceforge.net/'>EchoPoint</a> was created by
Brad Baker as a rich component library for
<a href='http://echo.nextapp.com/site/echo1'>Echo1</a>.  The project was
later re-implemented as EchoPointNG for
<a href='http://echo.nextapp.com/site/echo2'>Echo2</a> by Brad.  Brad has
stopped work on EchoPoint due to time and family constraints.</p>

<p>This project has been started by <a href='http://sptci.com/'>Sans
  Pareil Technologies, Inc.</a>, who wishes to continue to use the extensive
component library developed by Brad.  No further work on EchoPointNG is
planned, however a new component library that replicates most of the common
components of EchoPointNG for
<a href='http://echo.nextapp.com/site/echo3'>Echo3</a> framework will be
developed.</p>

<p>Echo has changed quite radically from version 
2 to 3 in that most component rendering is done in pure JavaScript on the
client-side, thus reducing the server-side resource utilisation of Echo
applications.  A regular port of EchoPointNG is hence not possible, and
requires total rewrite of the rendering peers for all components.</p>


<h3>Source Code</h3>

The sources for the re-implementation work as well as the original
EchoPointNG may be checked out from the project
<a href='https://echopoint.dev.java.net/source/browse/echopoint/'>subversion</a>
repository.

    <li>Note that it is not recommended that users use the <code>trunk</code>
    area since the status of the sources are likely to be unstable and not
    entirely tested.  The <code>trunk</code> area is primarily for the use
    of developers involved with implementing the library.  It is recommended
    that users use the latest version from the <code>tags/current</code> area.

<h3>Dependencies</h3>

The following libraries are used to build EchoPoint.  You will need them
in your applications to satisfy runtime dependencies.  The release ZIP files
contain the necessary libraries to build and deploy your applications using
EchoPoint.

  <li>XStream 1.3+</li>
  <li>Apache Commons File Upload and IO packages</li>

The following additional libraries are used to test and build the library.  These
libraries are not included in the release package.

<ul>
  <li>JUnit 4.4 - Used in the server-side test application.</li>
  <li>yuicompressor 2.3.5 - Used to package the client-side test application.</li>
</ul>
